Array job indices can be specified in various number of ways.

A job array with index values between 0 and 31:
#SBATCH --array=0-31

A job array with index values of 1, 2, 5, 19, 27:
#SBATCH --array=1,2,5,19,27

A job array with index values between 1 and 7 with a step size of 2 (i.e. 1, 3, 5, 7):
#SBATCH --array=1-7:2

As with all Slurm directives, the SBATCH command can be applied within the batch script or on the command line.

To convert a directory of files to include an array ID see the following example:


$ touch aaa.fastq.gz bbb.fastq.gz ccc.fastq.gz ddd.fastq.gz
$ ls
aaa.fastq.gz  bbb.fastq.gz  ccc.fastq.gz  ddd.fastq.gz
$ n=1; for f in *fastq.gz; do mv "$f" "$((n++))$f"; done
$ ls
1aaa.fastq.gz  2bbb.fastq.gz  3ccc.fastq.gz  4ddd.fastq.gz

An alternative would be to read in the files using sed. Insert the following in to the job submission script immediately after the Slurm 
directives. For example;

item=$(ls *.fastq.gz | sed -n ${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}p)

The example "folders" illustrates the use of datasets in separate folders. This example is derived from Compute/Calcul Canada.

See also the Octave array example for the use of multiple files or scripts as an array.
