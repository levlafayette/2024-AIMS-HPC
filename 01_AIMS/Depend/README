It is not unusual for a user to make the launch of one job dependent on the suc cessful completion of another job. The most common example is 
when a user wishe s to make the output of one job the input of a second job. They might launch bo th jobs simultaneously, but they do not want 
the second job to run before the f irst job has completed successfully. In other words, they want a conditional de pendency on the job.

Several conditional directives to be placed on a job which are tested prior to the job being intiatied, which are summarised as after, 
afterany, afterok, afte rnotok, singleton (e.g., sbatch --dependency=afterok:jobid1 job2.slurm). Multip le jobs can be listed as dependencies 
with colon separated values (e.g., `sbatc h --dependency=afterok:jobid1:jobid2 job3.slurm`).

Some dependency types

after:jobid[:jobid...]  job can begin after the specified jobs have started

afterany:jobid[:jobid...]  job can begin after the specified jobs have terminated

afternotok:jobid[:jobid...]  job can begin after the specified jobs have failed

afterok:jobid[:jobid...]  job can begin after the specified jobs have run to completion with an exit code of zero.

singleton	job can begin execution after all previously launched jobs with the same name and user have ended.
