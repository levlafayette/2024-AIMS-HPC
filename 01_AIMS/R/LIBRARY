R's extensions are known as libraries. 

A lot of these have been installed by the HPC sysadmins when the main package itself is installed. To check what libraries are 
available, load the R module and enter that environment. Then run the command to display the available libraries.

$ module load R/4.1.3
$ R
R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10) -- "One Push-Up"
..
> installed.packages(lib.loc = NULL, priority = NULL, noCache = FALSE, fields = NULL, subarch = .Platform$r_arch)

Note that the libraries available will differe for each version of R. 

Presence of specific libraries can be checked.

> library("snow")
Error in library("snow") : there is no package called ‘snow’
> library("parallel")
..

Sometimes a local (personal) library is required. Create a directory for local R libraries, invoke R, and install 
packages to that direcory. For example:

$ mkdir ~/R_libs 
$ R 
..
> install.packages("snow", repos="http://cran.r-project.org", lib="~/R_libs/")
..
> q();

$ echo 'R_LIBS_USER="~/R_libs"' >  $HOME/.Renviron
$ ls ~/R_libs/
snow

Check to see that the library path has been added correctly.

$ R
..
> .libPaths();
...
